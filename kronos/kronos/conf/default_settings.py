# instance.  In production, you will likely want a web-facing Kronos
# instance in `ServingMode.COLLECTOR` mode, which will only open up
# the `put` endpoint.  This way, javascript/frontend logging requests
# can come in from any remote machine, but remote machines can't get
# or delete the data in the Kronos store.
#
# Separately, behind a firewall, you will want to run a server in
# `ServingMode.READONLY` mode, which allows read-only access to the
# data for analytics processing without having to worry about errant
# puts/deletes.

#
# Namespaces are akin to tablespaces/databases in relational database
# systems.  `stream_prefix` allows you to handle different streams in
# a namespace differently.  For example, you might want slightly
# different settings for bursty streams.  Note that while you can
# write to multiple `backends`, you must specify a single
# `read_backend` to return data from. Here's an edited snippet from
# some production systems:
#
# namespace_to_streams_configuration = {
#   default_namespace: {
#     '': {
#      'backends': {
#        'cassandra': {
#          'timewidth_seconds': 60*60*24*7 # 1 week.
#          },
#        'memory': None
#        },
#      'read_backend': 'cassandra'
#      },
#    'product.web.views': {
#      'backends': {
#        'cassandra': {
#          'timewidth_seconds': 60*60 # 1 hour.
#          }
#        },
#      'read_backend': 'cassandra'
#      },
# ...
#
# Let's break this down: for the `default_namespace`, any stream with
# prefix `''` (the default) stores its data into both `cassandra` and
# `memory` (names we set in `storage` above).  The Cassandra time
# width is a week, meaning we bucket a week's worth of data by
# default.  However, streams with the prefix `product.web.views` are
# higher-throughput, and we store them in one-hour buckets to avoid
# overloading a single Cassandra key.  We write the data out to both
# Cassandra and the memory store (our `backends`), but if a user
# retrieves data, we'll pull it out of Cassandra (the `read_backend`).
